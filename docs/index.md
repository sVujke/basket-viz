## üé¢ Overlay

For more details read: 

-  [Static Trajectory](overlay/static-animated.md)
-  [Animated Trajectory](overlay/trajectory-animated.md)

```python
from basket_viz.overlay.trajectory import PlotTrajectory

pt = PlotTrajectory()

players = ["Hezonja, Mario","James, Mike","Lessort, Mathias"]
colors = [real_madrid_gold, monaco_red, panathenaicos_green]
v_lines = {1.0: 'Short-Range', 4.0: 'Mid-Range', 6.75: 'Three-Point Line'}

pt.plot_trajectory_animated(normalized_df, players, colors, v_lines=v_lines, title=f"Scoring Profiles \n EUROLEAGUE 23/24")
```

plotter = PlotRelationship(use_team_config=True,output_format='mp4')
plotter.plot_animated_relationship(

    team_filter="BAR",
    display_only_last_names=True,
